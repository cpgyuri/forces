## Doki Doki Forces - YuriKnife
# I can feel the tenderness of my skin though the knife,
# as if it were an extension of my sense of touch.
# My body gets high and overly excited.
# There are voices, incredibly faint,
# that scream: "Resist this pleasure, Yuri!!!",
# voices that are trying to make me stop...
# but I can already tell that the pleasure is too much.
# I can't... And I won't stop myself!
# My Third Eye is drawing me closer.
# The Ruby is drawing us closer.
# Your lust continues to linger through my body and veins, AND I WILL NOT STOP IT!!!
